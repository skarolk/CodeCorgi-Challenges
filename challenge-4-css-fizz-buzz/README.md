Code for the challenge[4] on the code corgi platform

Use CSS to change the colors of the rows on the table so it's easier to read.

For a row which position is a multiple of 3 make the background of the row this color: #6276A3,
for every 5th row make the background this color: #8AA6E5, and for rows that are a multiple of both
change the background color to #262E40.

You can add your code on the `css/app.css` file.
